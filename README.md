# Data-Viz
Data Visualisation Final Project 
Assignment 2: Interactive Data Storytelling
In the final project, your team will implement interactive data visualizations to turn your topic and the data into compelling storytelling.
Data storytelling is a method of communicating insights from data analyses through narratives and visualizations.
The team submitted four deliverables: 1) deploying the project on the web, 2) publishing your source code to GitHub, 3) a 10-minute presentation video, and 4) presentation slides.

The requirements of your project are the following:
At least 3 different views/visualization components (e.g., 3 bar charts only count as 1 component)
Multiple views coordinated with linked highlighting. A click/hover/selection interaction within one view must trigger a change in a different view. At least 2 views need to be linked. Ideally, these views are linked bidirectionally.
At least 2 UI widgets allow users to filter the data or update certain views interactively (e.g., dropdown, radio button, range slider, calendar).
Interactive tooltips are shown when users hover over marks, at least in one view.
You do not necessarily build backends; only an index.html file should be enough. Your interface should be as self-explaining as possible, with appropriate labels for panels, axes, and widgets, a legend documenting the meaning of visual encodings, and a meaningful title and description.

Video Presentation
The team should prepare a presentation video to describe your project and demo the tool. The video should be at a maximum of 10 minutes and uploaded to YouTube with public or unlisted visibility. Split the presentation so that everyone will take part in the presentation.
Your presentation will include the following:
1-min elevator pitch
What does your project visualize? and for whom?
Why is the project interesting/important?
Project description
What is the motivation?
Who and what is your tool for, more specifically?
What are your research questions?
What is the data source used in this project?
Project demo
An explanation of what the tool shows. Describe why the encoding you used makes sense for the visualization in regard to your research question.
A demo of the possible interactions in the tool.
A demo of some of the most interesting things you found in the tool.
Mention a few limitations of your tool.
Describe briefly how each team member contributed to the project.
You may find this guide on how to record and upload the video to YouTube.
You are encouraged but not required to make the presentation video public. At least you need to set the publicity as Unlisted so that we can access the video.

Submission
What to submit
On the submission form in Edunao, 1) provide a link to your presentation video, 2) a link to access your deployed tool on the web, and 3) a link to your source code in the GitHub repository.
Submit the presentation slide. The presentation slide must be in the pdf format and submitted in the “Final_[Your team name].pdf” format. The last slide should indicate who did what in the project.
When to submit: The final project is due before April 15, 23:00.
